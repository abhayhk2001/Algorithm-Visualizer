# React Todo List Application

Graph algorithm Visualizer application for tracing Warshall and Floyds Algorithm and visualize them using graphs.

## About Project

The application allows user to enter adjacency matrices as input and calculates the transitive closure in case of Warshall algorithm and the shortest path between each node for Floyds Algorithm. Then the output of the algorithm is pictorially represented using Graphs rendered using Cytoscape.js. The entire application is build using React and other supported packages.

## Getting Started

A working installation of `Node.js`, `npm` and `Git` verison control system is enough to start the project.
Instructions for Node installation can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Instructions for Git installation can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
NPM - a package manager for node is installed with Node.js.

### Installation

This project is built on the [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

1. Clone the project from GitHub using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/abhayhk2001/ReactDjango-Todo
```

2. Move into the created directory and start the native terminal in this directory. Install the required node modules for running the project.

```
$ npm install
```

3. Start the React development server with the following commands.

```
$ npm start
```

## Future of the project

Here are some of the changes to the project which I would like to incorporate into the project.

1. Allows users to enter graphs pictorially.
2. Add other important graph algorithms to the application.
3. Allow users to change the underlining algorithm and experiment with their own modifications so they are able to learn better.
